# NovaDrone-System

## Project Overview
NovaDrone-System is the development of a complete and high-performance electronic system for a custom quadcopter UAV. Designed and developed entirely from scratch, this project encompasses all necessary subsystems to make the drone fully functional. The system includes power distribution, motor control, flight stabilization, sensor integration, and communication subsystems, built with professional-grade precision.

## Key Features
- **Custom Flight Controller**: Developed from scratch to control flight dynamics and provide real-time feedback from various onboard sensors.
- **Power Distribution**: Optimized for efficient power management across all components.
- **Motor Control**: Electronic speed controller (ESC) integration for precise motor control, enabling smooth flight behavior.
- **Flight Stabilization**: Algorithms for stabilization and flight control, providing a stable and responsive flight experience.
- **Sensor Integration**: Includes sensor fusion for altitude, orientation, and positioning.
- **Communication Systems**: Custom wireless communication for remote control and telemetry data.

## Starting point
- **Frame**: ZD550 carbon fiber frame.
- **Motors**: QM4208 brushless motors.
- **Propellers**: 1455 carbon fiber propellers.

## Project Goals
This project aims to push the boundaries of custom UAV design by focusing on every aspect of the electronic system. NovaDrone-System is designed for high performance, reliability, and adaptability, from power management to flight control and communication.

## Architecture
The system is divided into the following main components:
- **Flight Control Unit (FCU)**: The heart of the system, managing flight control algorithms and real-time data processing.
- **Power Management System (PMS)**: Distributes power from the battery to the motors, sensors, and control systems.
- **Sensor Suite**: Includes IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units), GPS, and other relevant sensors.
- **Communication**: Wireless telemetry and control interfaces to interact with the drone in real-time.
